# PokePath

When I was working over the summer, a lot of my fellow interns were playing pokemon go but I didn't have enough time to dedicate to the game in order to keep up with my peers as I would bike home and need to either cook, do groceries, unwind etc. One of my unwind activities was watching netflix before sleeping and I came up with an idea to develop an application that would allow me to play Pokemon Go while watching netflix. Thus PokePath gave birth. The main idea of the application is that it will simulate my phones GPS location to "walk" my character in Pokemon Go which allowed me to play while watching netflix in bed! 

Pokepath is an application that uses Google Maps/Drive APIs to load in pokemon stop locations and allows you you place markers on the map to create a "path" that you wish your character to walk. The application needs to be connected to a debug session through xcode(requires a mac). When you are satisfied with your path, you can click generate path which will output a GPX file which you can then use to simulate the location of your phone. Walking speed has been set to 14km/h to stay under the detectable speed of Niantic. The path will loop from your first marker to your last marker. 
The point of the application is to create a way for people who either don't have the time to walk or can't walk around due to living in rural areas or people who may be physically disabled. 
Do not jump more than a city's worth of distance or you will be soft banned. The application is meant to walk around where you usually walk, not to spoof and jump to a location you would otherwise not be able to get to!

*disclaimer 
I realize that this is a breach of Niantics code of conduct but I believe that as long as your intentions are right and you are not using this application to affect other players experience with the game, then it is no difference than spending hours walking.
